# Hi, welcome to 5G-MAG's GitHub ðŸ‘‹

The [5G Media Action Group (5G-MAG)](https://www.5g-mag.com) 5G-MAG (Media Action Group) fosters collaboration between the media and information and communication technology (ICT) industries.
A core objective is to drive the market-oriented implementation of technologies for the connected media world, leveraging global Internet and 5G access technologies. The work spans from conception of a use case, service or application, up to implementation of proof-of-concepts and products.
We aim to be open, agile, pragmatic and instrumental to the industry. Therefore some of our activities are publicly handled within this GitHub.
