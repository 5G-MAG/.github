# Hi, welcome to 5G-MAG's GitHub ðŸ‘‹

The [5G Media Action Group (5G-MAG)](https://www.5g-mag.com) is an international association open to the industry to cooperate in technology development and accelerate its adoption through pragmatic, non-bureaucratic and action-based work.
- We join efforts to leverage global Internet, 5G-based access technologies and APIs that fuel the media applications of the future.
- We do not publish our own standards. We prefer to work closely with global standard-setting organizations relevant to the areas of work our members propose.
- We seek consensus among members and the wider industry with pre-standards work and studies.
- We help coordinate inputs on service, application and technical requirements among members.
- Our members elaborate specification profiles, implementation guidelines and educational material with the industry and users in mind.
- We have established the open-source 5G-MAG Reference Tools Development Programme to bring technologies closer to developers, help validate specifications, build PoCs and demonstrators and drive technology adoption.
- We aim to be open, agile, pragmatic and instrumental to the industry. Therefore some of our activities are publicly handled within this GitHub.
